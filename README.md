## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/alysonfranklin/ecs-service/releases).



[Basic example](examples/basic)

```hcl
module "my-service" {
  source                        = "github.com/alysonfranklin/ecs-service.git//?ref=1.0"
  VPC_ID                        = "vpc-9823742"
  APPLICATION_NAME              = "example-service"
  APPLICATION_PORT              = 8080
  APPLICATION_VERSION           = "latest"
  CREATE_ECR                    = true
  CLUSTER_ARN                   = data.aws_ecs_cluster.selected.arn
  SERVICE_ROLE_ARN              = data.aws_iam_role.selected.arn
  AWS_REGION                    = var.AWS_REGION
  HEALTHCHECK_MATCHER           = "200"
  HEALTH_CHECK_PATH             = "/"
  CPU_RESERVATION               = 500
  MEMORY_RESERVATION            = 256
  LOG_GROUP                     = "aws/ecs/example-service"
  DESIRED_COUNT                 = 2
  ALB_ARN                       = module.my-alb.alb_arn
  LOAD_BALANCING_ALGORITHM_TYPE = "round_robin"
  TARGET_GROUP_NAME             = "${var.APPLICATION_NAME}-tg"
  DEFAULT_TAGS                  = merge(var.DEFAULT_TAGS, { Name = "${var.DEFAULT_TAGS["Environment"]}-${var.APPLICATION_NAME}-tg" })
}
